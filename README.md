## Overview
This repository contains the code used to generate the results reported in the high-grade serous ovarian cancer somatic landscape paper including upstream processing of VCF files, downstream analyses, and code for figures and tables. Analyses include:
- VCF processing
- MutSig2CV (Lawrence et al. 2014)
- Differential expression analysis for identified genes (Love et al. 2014)
- COSMIC refitting (DÃ­az-Gay et al. 2023)
- KM curves and Cox models
