## Overview
This repository contains all the code needed to recreate the analyses, tables, and figures in the paper "Characterization of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma somatic features in Black individuals".  Black individuals experience worse survival after a diagnosis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) than White individuals and are underrepresented in ovarian cancer research. To date, our understanding of the molecular and genomic heterogeneity of HGSC is based primarily on the evaluation of tumors from White individuals. In the present study, we identified significantly mutated genes and characterized mutational signatures, and assessed their distributions by gene expression subtypes in 191 HGSC cases with self-reported Black race. We compared the occurrence and frequency of somatic mutations and signatures by self-reported race to historical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

## Data Availability
